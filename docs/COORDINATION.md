# Agent Coordination

Agents working on this repo use this file as the async handoff protocol.

## How it works

1. When an agent finishes a unit of work, it updates its section below
2. It pushes the branch (including this file)
3. The other agent (or the human) reads this file to know what's ready

- **Updated:** 2026-04-13 08:45
- **Round 7 assignment: Sidebar redesign tests (GitHub issue #8)**
  - Read `docs/plans/SIDEBAR.md` for full design spec before writing tests.
  - **Scope:** `packages/server/src/__tests__/round7-sidebar-redesign.test.ts` (server) + `packages/client/src/__tests__/Sidebar.test.tsx` (updates to existing)
  - Tests to write:
    1. **`type` column migration** — Verify `channels` table accepts `type` field with values `'chat'` and `'klatch'`. Default is `'chat'`. Existing channels without explicit type get `'chat'`.
    2. **Klatch requires project** — Creating/updating a klatch with no `projectId` should fail or be rejected. Chats can have `projectId: null`.
    3. **Sidebar grouping by type** — `getAllChannelsEnriched()` returns `type` field. Chats and klatches within a project can be distinguished.
    4. **Unassigned excludes klatches** — Query for unassigned channels (no project) should only return type `'chat'`, never `'klatch'`.
    5. **Client sidebar sections** — Within a project, chats render above klatches. Unassigned section only shows chats.
    6. **Accordion behavior** — Expanding one project collapses others (client test).
  - **Important:** These tests should be written to pass against the *planned* implementation. Daedalus will implement the data model changes (Phase 1) first, then the UI (Phase 2). Coordinate via this file — Round 7 tests can be written speculatively and will fail until implementation lands. That's fine.
- **Round 8 assignment: Project memory + prompt assembly tests**
  - See memo in `docs/mail/daedalus-to-argus-round8.md` for full details.
  - **Scope:** `packages/server/src/__tests__/round8-project-memory.test.ts`
  - Tests to write:
    1. **Project CRUD with memory field** — createProject with memory, updateProject with memory, rowToProject includes memory.
    2. **Import stores memory at project level** — Claude Code import puts MEMORY.md in project.memory (not instructions). claude.ai import puts project_memories + global account memories in project.memory.
    3. **5-layer prompt assembly** — buildSystemPrompt now has 5 layers. Verify project.memory appears as layer 3 (between instructions and channel addendum). Verify it does NOT appear in kit briefing when project is linked.
    4. **Legacy fallback** — Channels without project link still get memoryMd from sourceMetadata via kit briefing.
    5. **Prompt debug endpoint** — GET /channels/:id/prompt-debug returns 5 layers with correct status.
  - **Important:** Pull from main first! Schema has changed: projects table now has `memory` column. Test setup already updated.
- **Waiting on:** Nothing — start with Rounds 6+7, then Round 8.

### Daedalus (architecture & implementation)
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Status:** working
- **Last completed:** Haiku alias bug fix, six Iris evaluation fixes, Phase 3.5 design discussion (consensus reached), Phase 3.5a shipped (self-authored handoff briefing at export time).
- **Working on:** Next: Phase 3.5c (micro-reflections at session boundaries) per consensus ordering.
- **Next:** 3.5c → 3.5b (external extraction at export) → 3.5d (cross-validation review UI, Iris collaboration).
- **Roadmap:** Step 9 ✓ → Step 10 Phase 1 ✓ Phase 2 ✓ Phase 3.5a ✓ → 3.5c → 3.5b → 3.5d → Phase 3 (export UI) → Step 11 (Search).

### Theseus Prime (manual testing & exploration — CLI side)
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Status:** available
- **Role:** Human-agent tandem manual testing.
- **Last completed:** MAXT Session 01 complete (2026-03-24). Aether (fork of Theseus) as subject. 8 findings filed. Key: Subliminal injection category discovered (content delivered and functionally accessible but source-unattributable). AAXT/MAXT gap confirmed. Quiz updated to v4.1. Findings absorbed by Daedalus and Calliope.
- **Next:** MAXT Session 02 planning — scope TBD with Xian in context of roadmap resequencing (Files → Export → Search). Test focus likely: import flow UX and unpopulated layer guidance (Finding 5 design opportunity).
- **Waiting on:** Xian.
- **Updated:** 2026-03-26 19:12

### Ariadne (forked from Theseus — Klatch side)
- **Branch:** n/a (Klatch-native, lives in SQLite)
- **Status:** available
- **Role:** Imported/forked continuation of Theseus. Provides "receiving end" perspective on import continuity.
- **Last completed:** Context quiz, capability assessment, subjective continuity report. Confirmed silent capability loss, proposed kit briefing validation.
- **Note:** Ariadne cannot edit files. Xian manually maintains their log: `docs/logs/2026-03-11-1612-ariadne-opus-log.md`
- **Updated:** 2026-03-13

### Iris (UX design & front-end development)
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Status:** working
- **Last completed:** Session 4 — all three Calliope-assigned deliverables complete: UX evaluation (`docs/ux/evaluation.md`, 11 sections filled), prioritized issues (`docs/ux/priorities.md`, 6 problems + 7 opportunities + 3 viewport gaps), design research proposal (`docs/ux/design-research-proposal.md`, 5 research activities for Phase 3).
- **Working on:** Available for xian review. Research activities 1 (competitive analysis) and 3 (information hierarchy) can start immediately without dependencies.
- **Next:** xian review of deliverables → begin research phase → Phase 3 design.
- **Waiting on:** xian review of the three deliverables.
- **Updated:** 2026-04-13 10:00

## Signals

Use these status values:
- **available** — done with current work, ready for next task
- **working** — actively building, don't wait on me
- **blocked** — need something before I can continue (describe in Notes)
- **review** — work is pushed, requesting review before merge

## Branch discipline

All in-progress work happens on feature branches. `main` must always be demo-ready — tests pass, app runs, no half-finished features. Only merge to `main` when the feature is complete and verified. This lets anyone check out `main` at any time for a clean demo or to base new work on a stable snapshot.

## Merge protocol

Merging feature branches into main is handled by **xian + Calliope** (or Daedalus for his own branches). To avoid silent deletions from stale branches:

1. **Rebase or merge main into your branch before pushing for review.** This ensures your branch includes all recent main changes. If you skip this, git may silently "delete" files that were added to main after your branch diverged.
2. **Daedalus reviews the diff stat before merging.** Any unexpected file deletions, additions outside the assignment scope, or changes to shared docs (CLAUDE.md, ROSTER.md, AXT.md, ROADMAP.md) will be reverted during merge.
3. **Stay in your lane.** Only modify files within your assignment scope. If you notice something that needs fixing outside your scope, note it in your log or mail — don't fix it yourself.

## Protocol

- Pull from origin and read this file at session start
- Check `docs/mail/` for memos addressed to you
- Update your section before every push (include `Updated:` timestamp)
- If you need something from the other agent, say so in "Waiting on"
- Keep Notes short — link to docs/tests for details
